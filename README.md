Attached is my dataset. Only the first two tabs really matter. I have controls in the final few tabs but I figured for now I’ll leave them be, considering I can’t even figure out how to run a test with just independent variables.
 
The only positive progress I made was when I isolated independent variables (in the case of the two graphs below, first Manganese Ore and then Copper Ore). When I tried to pull in multiple independent variables the tests would stop working. Ultimately I have two questions: “What is the probability of a country receiving a swap if they export at least 5% of any critical green input globally?” and, “What is the probability of a country receiving a swap given how much of a critical green export they buy from China?”. The two first ‘master’ tabs have all the data, if I could only figure out how to run it..
